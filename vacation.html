<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> One of my favourite memories is spending quality time with my family, whether it was playing ping pong, spending time outdoors, or watching a movie. Our trip to Pulau Pinang in 2004 remains one of my fondest family memories. Even though I can't recall every detail of what happened, I do remember the majority of the noteworthy ones. A misty morning in the Batu Feringghi warmly welcomed me, and I could clearly hear the pounding of the ocean. I could see the tip of the sun just beginning to peek over the steep, snowy mountain peaks; however, the sun was quickly covered by the misty Pulau Pinang clouds as we travelled further down the road. Our family vacation was over!. </p></font>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> Travelling with someone you know is a very easy way to test your friendship. Whether you hardly know someone or think you'll be best friends for life, travelling disasters mean you will quickly find out a lot about another person through the way they react. Even the boring everyday parts of travelling will reveal a new side to their personality. I personally believe that travelling with your friends is the best way to travel! Whether this means backpacking round the world for a year, or just taking a weekend trip to a different city, I highly recommend the experience. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages. </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman"> The advantages, or upsides, of travelling with friends are quite obvious. You are guaranteed good company with someone you know you get along well with. If things go wrong, you know someone else will be there with you to help you get through it. Most people come back from travelling much closer to each other than they were before. It's also fun to create special and unique memories with someone close to you. It's a shame to spend some of the best moments of your life with complete strangers! One of the major advantages is that if you know the person you plan a trip with, you know what to expect from them. You know if they're a morning person or like to sleep late, whether they enjoy sightseeing or relaxing, and what their expectations are for the journey!. </p>
