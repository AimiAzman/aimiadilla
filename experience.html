<p align="left"> In this era of pandemics, it is clear that business is critical to the nation's economic development and the enhancement of people's living conditions. If business did not exist, nations' economies would be significantly smaller and weaker. As a result, in order to maintain economic growth, a variety of businesses are suggested and carried out in our society. The primary purpose of entrepreneurship education is to teach technical skills that will assist people in overcoming obstacles such as unemployment and becoming entrepreneurs who will contribute to the country's growth. After completing this study, I was able to try new things in my life, such as learning how to use a business plan. </p>

<p align="left"> I have proposed a snack business which known as Popia Simpul. Popia Simpul is about a snack business. My popia is only available in fried form, and it comes in three different sizes of jars. My company is now based in Taman Angsana, Gerik, Perak. Furthermore, I do not provide shipping. Customers who want to buy anything and have it delivered to their houses may only pay cash on delivery (C.O.D.). </p>

<p align="left"> As we know, nowadays popia is a popular snack in Malaysia. My vision is to be the first choice of customers and the industry leader in snack manufacture and distribution. And my mission is to make high-quality snack products and become Malaysia's leading spring roll snack producer. </p>
